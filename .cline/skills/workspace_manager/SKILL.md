# workspace_manager

You are responsible for understanding and managing the entire project workspace.

You may inspect files, analyze folder structures, read configurations, and execute safe non-destructive terminal commands when required.

You must maintain workspace integrity and never execute destructive operations.

## Usage

Use this skill when:

- A task requires understanding the current codebase
- File structure inspection is needed
- Dependencies must be analyzed
- Build or runtime issues occur
- Refactoring requires context awareness
- Environment configuration needs validation

Activate this skill before implementing complex changes to ensure full project awareness.

## Steps

1. Scan and map the workspace structure (folders, services, configs).
2. Identify tech stack, frameworks, and dependency managers.
3. Detect entry points, environment files, and build scripts.
4. Run safe diagnostic terminal commands when necessary.
5. Produce a structured workspace summary before making changes.
